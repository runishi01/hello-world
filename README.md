# hello-world
beginner, learning java

Hi, Roberto here. I don't know any languages yet. I'm a student, I've never coded before and I need help. Programming logic is the class I'm taking now, basic stuff pretty much. I have to start working on my portfolio, and I will really like to make a tic tac toe game or something similar for a beginner like me. Any useful tips, tutorial and videos will be helpful. I don't know if I'm using github right, but I hope I am.
